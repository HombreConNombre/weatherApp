# weatherApp
An weather app making using Django. I only want practice Python and REST.

# RUN APP
If you want to run the app follow this steps but, however, if you know deploy a Django app, deploy like basic Django app.
## 1 - Activate the enverioment
We are going to activate the enverioment to correct launch, it is in **envWeatherApp** folder.
> envWeather/Scripts/activate
## 2 - RUNSERVER
Now we have deploy and we are in the enviorement, only need this step and you have all deployed.
### You can jump this command if you prefer to don't move your pointer.
> cd WeatherApp
### Now we are going to run the WebAPP
> python manage.py runserver

# Remember
